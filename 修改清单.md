**Task: Redesign the Mobile Check-in Page.**

1. **Refactor `/checkin`:**
   - Remove any unnecessary navigation or "Home" buttons. It should be a standalone landing page.
   - **Visuals:** Change the background to a dark, deep-space theme (CSS radial gradients or a simple starry image).
   - **UI:** Center a translucent "glass-morphism" card.
   - **Form:** Only ask for "Name". Add a "Join Universe" button.
   - **Feedback:** After submission, do NOT redirect. Instead, replace the form with a success message: "Signal Sent. Look at the Big Screen." with a pulsing animation.

Task: Create the 3D Name Sphere Component.



Create component components/LotterySphere.tsx:

Use @react-three/fiber.

Data: Accept the list of users as props.

Math: Use the Fibonacci Sphere algorithm to calculate (x, y, z) coordinates for each user name so they are evenly distributed on the surface of a sphere.

Rendering: Use the <Html> component from @react-three/drei to render each name as a div floating at its calculated 3D position. This makes the text sharp and easy to style with Tailwind.

Look: The names should look like they are floating in space forming a globe. Add a subtle auto-rotation to the whole group when idle.

Task: Integrate 3D Sphere into /lottery and build the Game Logic.



Update /lottery page: Replace the old slot machine with the new <LotterySphere />.

Implement Animation States:

Idle: Sphere rotates slowly.

Spinning: When I click "Start", user useFrame to rotate the sphere group very fast on the Y and X axes.

Stopping: When I click "Stop", smoothly decelerate.

The Winner Logic:

When stopping, pick a random winner.

Calculate the rotation needed to bring that Winner's 3D coordinate to the front center (facing the camera).

Animate the sphere to that rotation using framer-motion-3d or a damping function in useFrame.

Effect: Once stopped, scale up the winner's name tag and hide/blur the others.
